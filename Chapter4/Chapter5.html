<h1>Low And Slow</h1>
<p>posted by BGB,November 15,2012</p>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called<em>sous vide.</em>In <em>Sous vide</em> cooking. You submerge the food(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)into a water
bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book,<cite>Cooking for Geeks,</cite>Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching".

 <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
